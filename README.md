# The Object-Oriented Thought Process Notes

This repository contains my notes from the book "The Object-Oriented Thought Process" by Matt Weisfeld. The book provides a clear and concise introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP) and its core principles. These notes are organized by chapters and cover the key concepts, important points, and personal insights gained from each chapter.
